                In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly
                 used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying 
                 on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used before final copy is available, 
                 but it may also be used to temporarily replace copy in a process called greeking,
                  which allows designers to consider form without the meaning of the text influencing the design.
